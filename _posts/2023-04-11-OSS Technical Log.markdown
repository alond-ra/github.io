**OVERVIEW**

This module focuses on introducing us, the apprentices, to the open-source community and contributing to open-source projects. This technical log describes my experience contributing to an open-source project. I spent time looking for a project to contribute to since lots of the suggested projects had no recent activity or I could not contribute. I ended up contributing to the translation (English to Spanish) of the Django documentation.


**CONTEXT**

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is “a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.” In its [GitHub account](https://github.com/django) there is a repository for the [translation](https://github.com/django/django-docs-translations) of its stable versions, each branch corresponds to a different stable version. Even though this is a GitHub repository, the translation process takes place in another platform: [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/). My [Transifex account](https://app.transifex.com/user/profile/alondra/) is linked to my GitHub account. I translated several chains of text in the django-localflavor folder, but they need to be reviewed. 

Additionally, I wrote my weekly essay (that is part of this module as well) and it can be read [here](https://alond-ra.github.io/github.io/weekly-essay/2023/04/10/Week-12.html).


**SOLUTION**

First of all, I had to find an open-source project that needed help and that I could contribute to. This first part of the module required us to make a simple contribution just as documentation, typo fixes, or translations to practice the process of getting a PR for the first time.

The Django documentation translation is open to receive contributions, it is the way this documentation has been translated since previous versions. 

As a parenthesis, the ‘About’ section of this repository used to have outdated information. I opened an [issue](https://github.com/django/django-docs-translations/issues/37) and suggested a correction. It got accepted and someone else made those changes. 

Its [README.rst](https://github.com/django/django-docs-translations#readme) file clearly indicates that to contribute translations to this project, it is needed to use the Transifex platform. I introduced myself on the Django documentation translation [forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/internals/i18n/14) and got accepted on the Transifex team to translate said documentation to Spanish. 

Transifex is pretty intuitive to use and I translated about 400 chains (most of them, were single words or even city names that do not need to be translated, but it has to be indicated). 

However, it is hard to document. I think that if you are not part of the team, you cannot see who made certain translations until it gets reviewed and added to the repository. As of 11/04/23, my contributions are still awaiting review.. To show my contributions, I’ll let these screenshots. The first one is from minutes after I started translating and the second one is from when I stopped.
