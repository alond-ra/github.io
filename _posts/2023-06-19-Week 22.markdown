This week was quite similar to the last one. I have been working on the BAH project with my teammates but also I kept reading about testing on Java and Python libraries. On the other hand, for the soft skills part, rather than reading, I talked with someone who is part of the Communication Enhancement Program and I also went to a couple of agile workshops.

For the BAH project, we kept adding tests. Our goal was to do unit tests (in this case we are taking certain methods as units; unit testing consists of checking that each unit works as expected, and we test them individually) for all the code that our team contributed to the project. For this, we consulted the JUnit documentation and watched a bunch of examples on YouTube. Additionally, I read the book “Mastering Software Testing with JUnit 5” by Boni Garcia. I haven’t finished it yet, though I started reading it a week ago. I started this book to get introduced to software testing with JUnit, and the first chapters do a good job. I'll mention, broadly, what they are about
Retrospective on software quality and Java testing: I got to understand what software quality is, its importance and some types and methods of unit testing.
What's new in JUnit 5: an overview of JUnit's past versions and advantages and improvements that came with JUnit 5, some examples.
JUnit 5 Standart Tests: This chapter has lots of examples to show the JUnit 5 model; emphasizing Jupiter: the module added in this 'new' version of JUnit. Its annotations are clear and useful. 
I want to keep reading it. This week I left it aside since there were other priorities. But I'll continue it.
