For this week, during the apprentice, I had to keep working on the breakable toy. For the overview, it is to develop a to-do list app. I reviewed some of the resources that the mentor mentioned, just as the videos "React - The complete guide" by Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and "Full-Stack React with Spring Boot".

Besides studying the resources that I was told I will have to use, I wanted to have a scheme to follow to develop this project. I did not want to get overwhelmed by all the topics that I was studying and not knowing where I have to apply them. Having this kind of scheme also helps me to organize my time and be more productive.

I know that having some sort of scheme or schedule does not guarantee that everything will happen as written in there. It was the case this time. I have to adapt it for the next weeks.

By the end of the next week, I should be done with the part of the backend.
