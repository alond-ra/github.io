The assignments for this week (and week number 3) were coding, the creation of this blog and mindfulness. For the mindfulness part, I am not accustomed to it, but once I focus, it is nice. I struggled with the mindfulness exercises because, at this time of the year, sometimes I have an allergy that makes it hard to breathe properly, as required in the exercise.

For the part of coding, I implemented two of the solutions to the group problems in Python, a language that I am familiar with. For the individual problem, I also used Python. I chose the Cryptopangrams one. With that problem, I learned a bit of list comprehension; something that I have used before but I am not used to it.

Since the solutions that I implemented to the problems do not use anything that I haven't used before (besides not being used to list comprehension), I cannot say that I learned something new from doing it. But, on not Apprentice Program-related stuff, I have been reading about natural language processing and just a bit of machine learning (for now just about optimization methods implemented to it) for school, it is interesting. 

On the other hand, in order to improve this blog, I have been learning about Jekyll and recalling some format stuff from HTML, it is been a while since I last used HTML!
