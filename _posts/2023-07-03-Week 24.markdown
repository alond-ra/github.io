This time I focused on getting ready for a mock interview but also studied other topics besides the relevant ones for the interview, such as more Selenium WebDriver methods and Jenkins. 

The mock interview was part of a new module for us (the apprentices). The objective of this interview, essentially, is to practice for real interviews so that the interviewee can manage anxiety in this kind of situation and be good at explaining concepts clearly and accurately. For the next round, I'll be the interviewer; the objective of this is to guide the interview, to be empathetic and provide feedback to the interviewee.
The suggested topics for the interview were: Algorithms, data structures, software engineering, programming paradigm, design patterns, agile, testing and specifics of the programming language of your interviewee's preference (in my case, I was the interviewee and I choose Python).
I created a list of questions I thought could be on the interview
For the algorithm and data structures part I reviewed some topics from the book "Introduction to algorithms" by T. Comen, C. Leiserson, L. Rivest and C. Stein. What topics? With this book, I briefly reviewed some topics that I consider that I manage at a good level such as data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps and hash tables and some classic algorithms such as some sorting algorithms (merge sort, bubble sort, radix sort and insertion sort and another kind of algorithms such as DFS (Depth First Search) and BFS (Breadth First Search).
For the rest of the topics (software engineering, programming paradigm, design patterns, agile, testing), I relied on internet resources to look for information to answer the list of questions previously mentioned. 
On the other hand, for the Python questions, I didnâ€™t had to create much Python related questions since there was a list of them and I already covered them for the Python mock interview I had on [week 22](https://alond-ra.github.io/github.io/weekly-essay/2023/06/19/Week-22.html).
I also checked some extra resources such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/)
