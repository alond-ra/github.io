# Week Number 3

February 6, 2023

By Alondra

This week was different from the first two weeks, where I attended onboarding meetings, read some articles and saw some videos. I consider that those weeks were enough to introduce me to Encora, but it seems like I will never stop learning in the Apprentice program. I am excited about it.

For this week and the next one, I will be working on solving some given problems at Google Code Jam in team (with my batch mates) and some other problems by myself. I started this blog. I just used a template that I found for GitHub pages. I have lots of things to improve in this blog, especially in design aspects and additional content.
The Google Code Jam problems have to be solved in four programming languages. Those programming languages I only have experience with Python and Java. And, since we are eight people in the 2023A batch, each one will submit two implementations, which, in my case, will be coded in Python. This week, my teammates (from the batch) and I, have a couple of calls to distribute the problems and discuss ideas. They are nice and they have interesting ideas. During week 4 we will be done with those problems. For the individual problems I have worked on about half of them, I'll keep working on those during week 4.

Since the assignments given during week 3 are thought to be done during two weeks, I am just in the middle of it. For now, everything has been going smoothly and I have not had blockers. I will keep working on those assignments.
